        <h1>WHAT INSPIRES YOU?</h1>
        <p>Thats a question every man and woman ponders about. We all grow up filled with dreams that aren't ours at the beginning.<br>
        Dreams our parents didn't achieve and the pass them on to you to achieve. Dreams like being a doctor. Am sure every child has thought of that, but such dreams are never brought to life because they are not our own. Many lack direction at some point stop dreaming. and those who strive and build dreams w#of there own, because of passion they work hard and give up a long the way because they failed so many times. And others never try because they are scared of failing. That covers 99% of all dreamers. Then later life the passionate dreamers who persisted hire up to build their dreams. <br>
    A certain man called jack died and went to heaven, he meets st peter and  notices he is very intelligent man. Since the man had thirst for millary knowledge he posed st Peter witha question. Who is the greatest military general that has ever lived? st Peter pointed at a certain man. jack responded by saying,"I knew that man, he was just a vendor" st Peter responded by saying," if he joined the army, he would has been the greatest military general ever. This shows most people never really reach their pontentials. Be consistent, if you fail change the plan but not the goal, try to be a practical dreamer and pray hard.</p>
